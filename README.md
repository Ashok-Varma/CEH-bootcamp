# Class technical setup process overview: https://vimeo.com/471972833
#
# On a per topic basis this course has: 
#  A. What information you need to know for the CEH v11 exam (knowledge) = readings
#  B. What you need to be able to do (tasks with tools) = labs
#  C. What and how a professional does it (skills)
#
# FILES
# They are not perfect, if you have constructive ideas on improvement email me.
# You do not need these files to attend class; they will be presented in class.
# I do make changes and trim down these files at class time due to the compressed schedule of covering a 30-hour class in 8 hours
# These files are meant as a START to your CEH exam preparation
# There are many links in the mindmaps to O' books so that can focus on GREAT readings
# You must learn and study the details yourself
# You must do the labs on your own
#
# Practice harder than you compete and you will win/pass
# I am your coach for the high jump of the CEH 11 exam
# I can show you how to train and help you adjust when you are off course
# I cannot jump for you
