##  A. What information you need to know for the CEH v11 exam (knowledge) = readings
##  B. What you need to be able to do (tasks with tools) = labs
##  C. What and how a professional does it (skills)

# FILES
## They are not perfect, if you have constructive ideas on improvement email me.
## You do not need these files to attend class; they will be presented in class.
## I do make changes and trim down these files at class time due to the compressed schedule of covering a 30-hour class in 8 hours
## These files are meant as a START to your CEH exam preparation
## There are many links in the mindmaps to O' books so that can focus on GREAT readings
## You must learn and study the details yourself
## You must do the labs on your own

## Practice harder than you compete and you will win/pass
## I am your coach for the high jump of the CEH 11 exam
## I can show you how to train and help you adjust when you are off course
## I cannot jump for you
