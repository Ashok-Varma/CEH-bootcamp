# Exam Pre process- Application fee $100 + application
# This course has 3 componets for every topic: 
#  A. What you need to know 
#  B. What you need to be able to do 
#  C. Tricks played on people who do not buy from ECC
# FILES
# They are not perfect, if you have constructive ideas on improvement email me.
# You do not need these files to attend class; they will be presented in class.
# These files are HTML only (some are zipped), any browser will render them, they are the full presentations for students to review
# For the files that are zipped with a password, I will reveal the password in the O' class so you must attend or have access to the recording
# I do make changes and trim down these files at class time due to the compressed schedule of covering a 30-hour class in 8 hours
# These files are meant as a START to your CEH exam preparation
# There are many links in the mindmaps to O' books so that can focus on GREAT readings
# You must learn and study the details yourself
# You must do the labs on your own

# I am your coach for the high jump of the CEH 11 exam
# I can show you how to train and help you adjust when you are off course
# I cannot jump for you
# Practice harder than you compete and you will win/pass
