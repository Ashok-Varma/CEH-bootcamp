# FILES
# They are not perfect, if you have constructive ideas on improvement email me.
# You do not need these files to attend class & they will be presented in class
# These files are HTML only (some are zipped), any browser will render them, they are the full presentations for students to review
# For the files that are zipped with a password, I will reveal the password in the O' class so you must attend or have access to the recording
# I do make changes and trim down these files at class time due to the compressed schedule of covering a 30 hours class in 8 hours
# These files are meant as a START to your CEH exam preparation
# You must learn and study the details yourself
# You must do the labs
